		Dimensional metrology and alignent methods are significant and vital during different manufacturing processes. Dimension inspection processes play a crucial role in controlling the position accuracy of production \cite{gu2020study}. P Maresca et al identified the trends in metrology associated with quality control at the industrial level: fast, more precise and more flexible \cite{maresca2019evaluation}. The highly automated measuring and control systems demanded by the industries could use several approaches to extract more values from traceable measurements \cite{hall2019opportunity}. An industrial metrology process is uswd on industrial systems, components nad objects to perform inspections, alignment and measurement \cite{morumachine} It offers economic argument regarding the effects of intristic standard technology advances and considers the measurement information infrastructure's potential impact on cost effectiveness and risks for Iot measuring instruments adoption \cite{kuster2020measurement}. Metrological systems are based upon the principle of good alignment system. The inspection and alignment of large scale components with a strict precision were concernedd in the high-tech and heavy industry \cite{gu2020study}. Good alignment inspection is one of the most important methods to ensure safe management.
